# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within route handlers that interact with databases.

The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches user data from a database.  It lacks proper error handling, potentially leading to cryptic 500 errors and hindering debugging.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling. It demonstrates best practices for handling database errors, providing more informative error messages to both the client and server-side logs.
